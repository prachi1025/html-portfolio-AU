# html-portfolio-AU

This is the first project that I implemented from "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" by Angela Yu.

Also this is my first repositry that I created on my own.

This project is a very basic portfolio website thet is developed using only basic HTML tags initially, but later on basic CSS styling is added.
